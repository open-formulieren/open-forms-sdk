# Introduction

You are looking at the technical documentation for the Open Forms SDK.

This documentation contains both public and private API. Anything that is not under the private API
category may be considered public API.

## Intended audiences

The intended audiences are:

- developers wishing to override or modify their own SDK build. If you belong to this group, you
  should limit yourself to the public API.
- developers working on the SDK itself, typically team members in the open-formulieren Github
  organization.
- (future) theme designers wishing to create a theme to alter the look and feel without making
  javascript changes. This will become available as a reference of available design tokens per
  component.

## Goals

The goals determine the architecture and technical decisions of the SDK implementation.

**Theming using NL Design System**

One of the major goals of the SDK is that it can adapt itself to the theme of your organization
through the use of "design tokens", following the principles of
[NL Design System](https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/).

**Modifying layout using custom 'display components'**

For more complex layout changes that cannot be achieved purely through design tokens, we wantto
provide sufficient controls to replace our default components with your own custom components. This
should not require duplicating/managing any SDK-specific state - only pure React components are
allowed (pure = purely prop-driven).

This override mechanism is also opt-in on a per-component basis - e.g. if a display component is not
specified, the default version of the SDK is used.

**The SDK implements all the necessary API interaction and state management**

Developers focusing on design/layout should not need knowledge of the backend API, nor the
transitioning between states of the SDK. The value of the SDK is that it wires together the API
calls in the correct order and manages the error handling.

People working on public API aspects should only need knowledge of Javascript, HTML, CSS and React
basics.

Taken to the extreme, this implies that it will become possible to use _other_ design systems than
NL Design System, for example by replacing relevant components with web components or even vanilla
JS operating directly on the DOM.

## SDK Development

Please make sure you have reviewed the [contributing guidelines][contributing] (note that this
document links back to the page you are currently reading).

### NodeJS environment

- We use the `yarn` package manager
- The compatible NodeJS version is specified in `.nvmrc`, we recommend using
  [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Local development (storybook)

When your developing components in isolation without backend interation, it is often easier to do
this by using storybook.

```bash
yarn storybook
```

Storybook is both a documentation and development tool. Using the `play` interaction testing is
recommended, as this is also executed in the CI pipeline.

### Local development (with live backend)

Local development is typically done using the development server. This workflow should be familiar
for people familiar with `create-react-app`.

**Backend server**

A backend server is required in this development flow. We recommend spinning this up using
[docker-compose](https://open-forms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/docker_compose.html#installation-docker-compose).

Alternatively (read: full stack developer) you can set up the
[backend development stack](https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/blob/master/INSTALL.rst).

**Configuring your local env**

It is recommended to configure your local environment through `.env.local`, example content:

```
REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
REACT_APP_FORM_ID=dev
```

For `REACT_APP_FORM_ID`, use the slug or UUID of a form that you have
[built](https://open-forms.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/forms/basics.html#nieuw-formulier-aanmaken)
in the backend environment.

**Development server**

To start the development server

```bash
yarn start
```

This should open the browser automatically, alternatively navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Design tokens

Design tokens are defined in the
[`design-tokens`](https://github.com/open-formulieren/design-tokens/) repository and shared between
the SDK and backend project.

If the current design tokens are sufficient, installing the project dependencies will pull them in.
However, if design tokens need to be added or modified, it's recommended to check out the git
submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

Please avoid using sass-variables for design-tokens. The preferred approach is to use the CSS
variables resulting from the design tokens build.

### Translations/localization

We use `react-intl` to manage translations. All literals in the codebase should be defined as
`FormattedMessage` preferable, or an equivalent construct otherwise. Please extract and compile the
messages for every PR to avoid console errors about missing translations.

The actual translations are managed right before a new version is released.

Commands:

```bash
yarn makemessages
yarn compilemessages
```

### Code-style

**Prettier**

Please follow the existing code style. This project was initialized with Create-React-App and is
augmented with prettier. Either configure your editor or `git` pre-commit hooks to apply the
formatting with prettier:

```
yarn checkformat  # to lint
yarn format  # to reformat (writes files)
```

**Import style**

The project has been configured to be able to use 'absolute' imports, which means:

**Do**

```jsx
import SomeComponent from 'components/SomeComponent';
```

**Don't**

```jsx
import SomeComponent from '../../SomeComponent';
```

Imports are also sorted using a prettier-plugin.

**Don't change code without cause**

Code changes purely for formatting reasons are frowned upon. Only code changes that are necessary to
resolve a ticket are allowed.

Refactors of course happen, but they should be a separate pull request with their own ticket.

**Avoid classes and inheritance**

We tend to favour functional programming style and composition over OOP and inheritance. Using
simply datastructures often makes searching through and understanding the code easier.

This implies:

- do not use class-based React components, instead use functions and hooks
- favour objects (key-values mappings) of callbacks over classes and sub-classes

One big exception is of course Formio which is mostly class/inheritance based and out of our
control.

### Build targets

The source code is built to multiple targets for different audiences:

- UMD bundle with single JS/CSS files, for drop-in embedding and plain JS usage.
- NPM package containing the UMD bundle **and** ES-modules of the main components.
- Storybook static build (you're reading this now!)
- Docker image containing the UMD build for easy deployment, embedded in the backend build.
