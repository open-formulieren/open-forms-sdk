# Abortion Button

The abortion button can be used to abort a submission whether the user is authenticated or not.

- If the user is authenticated, then the button will have the text 'Log out' to comply with Logius
  directives that whenever a user is logged in with DigiD a 'Log out' option must be available. When
  GovMetric is enabled, a new window will open where the user can give feedback.
- If the analytics tool 'GovMetric' is enabled, aborting the submission will open a new window where
  the user can give feedback about why they decided to not fill the form until the end.
