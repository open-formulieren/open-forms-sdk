## Contact details step

The appointment form requires users to provide certain contact details. Which fields depend on the
configuration of the appointment plugin and may even be influenced by the selected product(s).

Required fields are retrieved from the API, which returns a list of Form.io component definitions.
This step in turn renders these.
