# Language selection

The language selection allows end-user to switch between available languages, as supported by the
backend.

The component handles:

- Fetching available languages from the backend
- Reading the preferred language via the backend and the HTTP `Accept-Language` header
- Handle the user language-changed events and propagate them up the component tree

It then renders the available languages and highlights the active one.

### Props

<ArgTypes of={LanguageSelectionStories.Functional} />

### Errors

Errors are left to bubble up to the nearest `ErrorBoundary`, e.g. if for some reason the language is
unavailable, then a `ValidationError` is returned from the API.
