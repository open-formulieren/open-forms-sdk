# Login Options

The `LoginOptions` component displays the options that are available for a user to authenticate when
starting a form.

A form requires authentication as soon as any of the steps requires authentication, otherwise
starting the form anonymously is an option too. This is communicated through the
`form.loginRequired` property.

## Presentation

The `LoginOptionsDisplay` component shows the different buttons that can be clicked to start the
authentication process. Next to each button, the corresponding logo is displayed. The icons have
either a dark or light appearance, affecting the color of the focus ring for accessibility.

Note that the anonymous form start option is implemented as a button with `type="submit"` and is
therefore expected to be nested inside of a `<form>` element with an appropriate `onSubmit` handler.

## Functional

The `LoginOptions` component handles the 'smart' part of the component. It separates the login
options between the ones that can be used to 'login as yourself' and the ones that can be used to
log in 'on behalf of someone else'. It also formats the labels that will be displayed on the buttons
and creates the appropriate URL to which the user will be redirected upon clicking one of the
buttons.

### Co-signing

When the form contains a co-sign component, an additional button is displayed for the co-signer to
start this flow, taking them to the configured authentication plugin.
