# DateField - datepicker

## Date picker widget

The date picker widget is suitable for nearby dates (in the future or past).

A calendar component is appropriate because:

- you can display occupied dates and/or date ranges
- you can indicate the current date
- it is not expected that the user needs to click the year/month button too many times

We aim to make it accessible to assistive technology and keyboard-only navigation.

### Known issues/enhancements:

- Use arrow keys to navigate inside calendar
- Selecting a date in the next/previous month has some odd behaviour at the moment

## Widget prop

Use the prop `widget="datepicker"` to use this widget.

<Canvas of={DatepickerStories.Datepicker} story={{height: '60ex'}} />

## Props

<ArgTypes of={DateField} />

## No asterisks

The backend can be configured to treat fields as required by default and instead mark optional
fields explicitly.

<Canvas of={DatepickerStories.NoAsterisks} story={{height: '60ex'}} />
