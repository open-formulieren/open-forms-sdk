# Number inputs

Numeric inputs are essential for some types of data, but using the correct inputs is rather hard due
to a couple of reasons:

- some data looks numeric, but actually isn't
- associated validations (minimum and maximum values)
- accessibility concerns (especially when silently truncating or ignoring data)
- localisation - different locales use different decimal separators

The implementation of our `Number` component attempts to address these, and has taken certain
sources into account when doing so:

- [GOV.UK](https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/)

## SSN, Credit card, phone numbers...

Do not use the `NumberField` for these, instead use a `TextField`, possibly with
`inputmode="numeric"` and `pattern=[0-9]+` props.

This kind of data are actually just text inputs/strings that happen to consist only of digits. As a
rule of thumb, if leading zeroes are significant, you should use a `TextField` instead.

## Free form number fields

Free form number inputs allow entering arbitrary numbers - decimals, negative, large, small... They
take the current locale into account and present formatted numbers. E.g. in the NL locale, the `.`
decimal separator will be converted to a comma, while thousand groups are automatically formatted
with a period.

Only numerical keyboard entries are allowed.

**TODO**: check accessibility impact of this!

The developer/form designers are responsible for defining validation rules for the values to express
minimum/maximum values.

**Notes**

- Props like `min` and `step` are ignored as they only apply to the `type="number"` inputs, which
  aren't supported by the underlying `react-number-format` library.

- The interaction tests rely on the NL locale. TODO: figure out how to change the locale in play
  functions.

fields explicitly.
