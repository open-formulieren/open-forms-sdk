# FormStep component

The `FormStep` component is the heart of the application.

It fetches the (dynamic) configuration from the backend, reconciles it with the submission data and
ensures that the form fields are rendered by passing the configuration and data down to the Formio
form renderer.

The component depends on a React Router parent, as the requested form step is taken from the URL
parameters.
