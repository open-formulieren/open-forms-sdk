# Upgrading from 3.0.x to 3.1.x

In the Open Forms SDK 3.1.0 release cycle we've upgraded some of our own dependencies that
unfortunately can cause visual changes if you use a custom theme. We've documented the changes here.

## Design tokens

In short - we have upgraded the community NL Design System components from version 1.0.0 to version
7.4.0 (see the
[upstream changelog](https://github.com/nl-design-system/utrecht/blob/e4515df1b2193defa20bd8704acc7a9f12d5231e/components/CHANGELOG.md)).
We are planning to switch over to the individual component CSS packages, but for that we first
wanted to deal with all the possible breaking changes while we had the chance.

There are two affected components in Open Forms.

**Alert**

The alert component displays errors and informational messages.

- The token `--utrecht-alert-icon-gap` was renamed to `--utrecht-alert-column-gap`. Update your
  tokens and/or stylesheets accordingly.

**Button**

The button component is displayed full-width on mobile devices. After the upgrade, this may no
longer be the case.

- Set the design token `--utrecht-button-max-inline-size` to `100%`
