The Open Forms SDK is the frontend to the [Open Forms backend][backend]. We publish it as both an
NPM library of components and pre-built [Docker image][docker].

The documentation is available [online][docs]. Note that the SDK documentation is currently lacking.
We're planning to publish Storybook documentation soon.

## Audience

The target audience for this library is developers who want to compose their own version of the SDK
without forking the repository.

Open Forms is developed as a white-label application, including the SDK. While the UI components are
fairly generic, there are more organization/theme-specific layouts possible, requiring significant
markup changes.

Rather than exposing and maintaining complex options for UI-component customization, we decided to
publish the SDK as a library so that (experienced) developers can replace components as they need.

## Usage

The package exports two ways to use the library:

1. Importing and composing the invididual modules (ESM)
2. Importing the library as a whole

The former approach allows more fine-grained control and should exclude code/dependencies that
aren't used and result in smaller builds, while the latter gives you the public API as it would be
available in the browser.

Given the target audience, we expect developers to use option 1.

### Using individual modules

The underlying React components are published and can serve as a basis for your own components, or
even completely replace them (TODO - this is on the roadmap!).

E.g. to re-use the card component:

```jsx
import Card from '@openformulieren/sdk/components/Card';

const MyCard = props => <Card titleComponent="h3" {...props} />;

export default MyCard;
```

**NOTE**: the published components are semi-private API. We cannot provide guarantees that it will
be 100% backwards-compatible. If we know breaking changes are made, we will bump the major version
number, but you should probably do extensive testing even with minor versions.

**Exposed API**

The `package.json` describes the module exports, at the time of writing these are:

- `@openformulieren/sdk/components/*`
- `@openformulieren/sdk/hooks/*`
- `@openformulieren/sdk/types/*`
- `@openformulieren/sdk/map/*`
- `@openformulieren/sdk/sdk`
- `@openformulieren/sdk/utils`

These will be documented with Storybook at some point.

### Using the library

If you decide that using the SDK itself is sufficient, then your usage comes down to:

```js
import OpenForm, {
  ANALYTICS_PROVIDERS,
  Formio,
  Templates,
  OFLibrary,
  OpenFormsModule,
  setCSRFToken,
} from '@open-formulieren/sdk'; // JS API
import '@open-formulieren/sdk/styles.css'; // import the (default) stylesheet

const form = new OpenForm(targetNode, options);
form.init();
```
