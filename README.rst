Easily integrate forms from Open Forms in your own website
(`Nederlandse versie`_)

Developed by `Maykin Media B.V.`_, commissioned by `Dimpact`_.


Introduction
============

The Open Forms Javascript SDK (source development kit) enables users to embed, 
render and submit forms that are defined in `Open Forms`_. The SDK leverages 
the Open Forms API, and is built on top of the `formio.js`_ SDK.

A default style is included but rendered form elements can be styled in line 
with your own website.

Open Forms is developed in line with the `Common Ground`_ principles,
with many plugins for government usage and with a strong focus on usability for 
both end users and administrators.
